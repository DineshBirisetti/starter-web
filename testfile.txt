Dozens of people are shown in the footage throwing kicks and punches at each other in an attempt to get hold of a large ball in Atherstone, Warwickshire. They were taking part in the Atherstone Ball Game, which dates back more than 800 years to medieval times. The footage starts with dozens of men fighting over the ball and pummelling each other to the ground. Later in the video, at least two men are sheltering in an open shop doorway while two assailants try to fight their way in. The person who is holding the ball at 5pm in the event is declared the winner, although this year's game was so violent that the ball was broken and had to be replaced.
